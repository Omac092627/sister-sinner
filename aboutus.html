<div class="aboutUsColumns">

  <p><img id="dipendra" src="images/Dipendra big.png" style="width:225px;height:225px;"><br>My name is Dipendra Khatri. Currently, I am working as a Database Administrator in a Navy Base near Seattle, WA and attending Software Development bootcamp after work. I was in the military for 4 years and also held some customer facing positions after getting out of the military. I like front-end development and I am also interested in machine learning (AI stuff). That’s why I am learning JavaScript followed by Python which are offered in the evenings and also fit my schedule. My ideal environment to use my software development skills would be one of the various fields like defense, real estate, e-commerce, cloud services where I can grow my skills with a decent work-life-balance.</p><br>
  <p><img id="adam" src="images/adam.png" style="width:225px;height:225px;"><br>Adam Owada is a safety officer and software developer based out of Seattle, Washington. During the day he can be found on the jobsite enforcing safety rules and mitigating safety hazards with his team. At night he is a student at Code Fellows 201, where he is currently studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. His dream job would be as an AI engineer. He has a passion for logic games and puzzles, and believes in the power of technology to solve business problems. At home he has a wonderful dog named Brock. Outside of work and school, Adam enjoys fitness, coffee, and Harry Potter trivia.</p><br>
  <p><img id="nat" src="images/nat.png" style="width:225px;height:225px"><br>Hi my name is Natalie Sinner and I currently work for Tesla as a service technician. Tesla is a software company that decided to build a car and a lot of what I currently do at work is related to coding. This has sparked an interest in learning more about coding and what I am doing in my daily job. I wanted to further my knowledge and grow this new found spark into something bigger. I am currently taking software development classes at Code Fellows in Seattle. There I am learning HTML CSS JavaScript and will finish off with Python. My Harry Potter house is Ravenclaw.</p><br>
  <p><img id="lami" src="images/lami.png" style="width:225px;height:225px"><br>Hello, my name is Lami Beach. I’m 28 years old and originally from Phoenix,  Arizona. Before I transitioned into programming I was involved in just about everything film. My main focus was screenwriting. I’ve worked on movie sets, television sets, and also have written eight screenplays. Unfortunately, I didn’t take the leap and move to Los Angeles because of the cost of  living. So I decided to switch gears and move into programming because of the various opportunities and how lucrative those opportunities are. I picked this specific field because I’ve been a computer junkie my whole life. My dream job is to work with video games. In just about any way, shape, or form. I enjoy them because they give me a sense of freedom.</p><br>
